There are in total three notebooks, since we need to distribute the computational resource,
we test models on different devices so that we can speed up

GNN_project is the notebook that we train Basic GNN model, GIN model and GraphGASE model on all the datasets.
GNN_MLP_Baseline is the notebook that we train baseline model on all the datasets
GNN_MLP_ENZYME is the notebook that we specifically test for the ENZYME datset due to the huge difference between our output and that of the paper.
